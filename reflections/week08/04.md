## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing- test small parts in isolation
Component Testing- testing a component requires it to be mounted to a DOM and ensures the units get along.
End-To-End (E2E) Testing- test of what a user with experience while using the app

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

end to end.  This is the real test, the other 2 are really just their to make this one go smoother.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I'm most likely to skip the unit test part, debugging during a component test often points to the problem and I can do unit tests as needed.
