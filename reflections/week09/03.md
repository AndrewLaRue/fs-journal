## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

 Base64 is an encoding schema used for representing binary data in a text format. This allows you to include the image straight into your HTML.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

Larger file size(25% on average)

Caching Issues- the browser is unable to store the images locally so it will always need to fetch them from your server or CDN which creates extra load on your server as well as increases your bandwidth bill.

User experience issues such as extra work on the CPU to decode the images and sharing images is much harder due to the fact that they are not actually accessible via a public URL.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

Its not that these drawbacks didn't exist in the past, it's that many of the other problems Base64 was created to solve are now handled in other ways and has skewed the Pro/Con(s) in a negative way.
