## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

scryfall api, google maps, google places, sockets for live chat, multiple different relationships

2. What went well so far?

Everyone on our team has a fantastic work ethic and, while there have been challenges, that has made almost every aspect go well.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

I think the biggest thing so far is the tendency to make a new component instead of modifying an existing one to work for several different areas.
