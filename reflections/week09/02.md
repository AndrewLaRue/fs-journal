## Questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?

Github actions help offload some of the toolings to GitHub by creating up to 20 workflows(text files).

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?

Thru Workflows, Gh actions can handle common build tasks, like continuous delivery and continuous integration. You can also have tasks that run on a specific time frame, or that control what happens when somebody interacts with the GitHub repository itself.

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?

Workflow/Scheduled- These workflow events manage the triggering of the actions. Something like a push, a pull request, or a fork that refers to changes in the repository.

Webhooks/External- some action that GitHub performs, like when somebody stars your repo or when a Wiki page gets created or edited. you can have an event triggered by an external process outside of GitHub. Thatâ€™s called a repository dispatch event. And you would use that when you want something external to communicate back with your GitHub repo
