## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

a column is a list of pieces of data that each item shares and a row is all of a single items data pieces. 

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
 name STRING NOT NULL,
 age STRING NOT NULL,
 description STRING NOT NULL
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name; 
DROP TABLE table_name;
```

DROP will delete all data and the table structure as well. DELETE will delete the data but the table structure will remain the same and we can still rollback the data.
