## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value-holds a data value within its own memory space and the variables directly contain values.

Reference- doesnâ€™t store its value directly. Instead, it stores the address where the value is being stored.

Pointer-Pointer types do not inherit from object and no conversions exist between pointer types and object.Also, boxing and unboxing do not support pointers. However, you can convert between different pointer types and between pointer types and integral types.

When you declare multiple pointers in the same declaration, the asterisk (*) is written together with the underlying type only; it is not used as a prefix to each pointer name. For example:

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, ushort

Theres a lot more of them.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?
 
Its like having a debit card with 10k in the bank(reference) instead of 10k in your pocket(value).  The card gives access to the money without need to carry the entire mass of it.
