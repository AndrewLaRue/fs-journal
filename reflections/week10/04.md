## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Strongly typed constants. They are essentially unique types that allow you to assign symbolic names to integral values. 


2. How can you modify an Enum?

The elements of the enum are read-only and changing them at runtime is not possible, nor would it be desirable.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

Limit an option for user input.  have input type as string and enum "yes" or "no" and it wont recognize any other string
