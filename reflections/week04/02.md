## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending
Resolved
Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

easier to read, chaining them together so it makes sence as you read it instead of needing to jump around to get a handle on it. 

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

then runs after, catch runs instead. success(hopefully), before failure.
