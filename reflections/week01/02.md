## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A keyword added to a selector to specify a certain attribute of the element.
hover and required are useful for different reasons. hover will let you know when your mouse is over something and required makes it to where you cant submit a form with out the input field being filled.

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

How much 'weight' a particular change has.  When multiple styles can apply to the same element, specificity determines who comes out on top. When specificity is equal, the last one rendered is the one that shows up for the long run.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

Styles that cant be over ridden can throw a wrench into trouble shooting.  Overuse of the important tag can really slow you down when your trying to make minor adjustments to things on an individual scale when its applied more globally.
