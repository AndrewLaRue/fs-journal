## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

Give a basic outline of what is going to be in the app and its general location.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low-fidelity: basic layout, often with empty boxes for images, lines for text etc. 

mid-fidelity: step up from low, maybe has some generic placeholder images and text along with headers maybe footers.  You will have most if not all of the layout and design in placce but no functionality.

hi-fidelity: step up from mid.  looks like a real site, often has some functionality(thru a site like figma).  Should be a carbon copy of the site when finished.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

low-fidelity: for sure, everytime.  Even if it changes by the end, having a outline to start really helps get the ball rolling.  

mid-fidelity: I think you would be better served with either a high or a low.  No half measures.

hi-fidelity: yes, especially if you aren't the one paying for it.  Getting approval for everything on a hi-fidelity model before wasting time making it is always good.
