## Questions

Not to go overboard on colors or designs, often times less is more.  Having 20 different colors and several distinct designs can be distracting to the end user. 

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Everything from popular websites and magazines to art or even architecture can give you different ideas to play with. 

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

A cluttered site can make you seem unorganized and unprofessional.  on the flip side, a site with too little information can make you seem lazy or even ignorant.
