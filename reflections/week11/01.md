## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

It enables the construction of a hierarchy of related classes that can reuse, extend and alter the behaviors defined in the existing classes.


2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

private members- arenâ€™t visible from child classes.
protected/internal members- visible *only *in child classes
public members- not only accessible, part of the public interface

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

All types and type members have an accessibility level. The accessibility level controls whether they can be used from other code in your assembly or other assemblies.
