## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I like pretty much everything about the course.  Working with my head has been a nice change of pace and being surrounded by people who don't hate what they do has taken some getting used to. I prefer c# to node js, but thats mostly due to liking the tables in mysql.  Many to many are still hard to wrap my head around but getting easier every day.  The size of this project is nice in that i can jump around if i get stuck on something too long and feel like im hitting a wall.  I still feel like my understanding of many aspects of coding is very shallow and the more i learn, the more there seems to be to learn.  It's never ending and I find that soothing in a weird kind of way.
